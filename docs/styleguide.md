1.  ##### Icon Dimensions and Layout
    
    *   **Canvas Size:** All icons should have a canvas size of 120px by 120px pixels.  
        
    *   **Verification:** Make sure icons are still recognizable at 24px by 24px in .png format.
  
3.  ##### Stroke and Fill
    
    *   **Stroke Width:** The main, often the outline stroke is 7px (when using 120x120 art board).  
        Additional details are more flexible, but keep it visible, easy to read, and apparent at smaller sizes.  
        _Note: Try to match the sizing of similar icons._

    *   **Stroke Properties:** Outline all strokes to ensure proper scaling.
    *   **Fill:** Icons should be outlined, with no fill color unless specified otherwise. Filled variants are allowed. See _File Naming Conventions_
  
5.  ##### Color Palette
    
    *   **Color:** #000000 (black)
    *   **Transparency:** None
    *   **Additional Color(s):** None
    *   **Background Color:** None
  
7.  ##### Letters, Numbers, and Symbols
    
    *   **Font:** Fredoka (Medium)
    *   For Letters, Numbers, and Symbols within the icons (ex: ?, !, i, etc) Fredoka is used as a reference.

9.  ##### Grid and Alignment
    
    *   **Pixel Grid:** Ensure all icons are aligned to a 40x40 pixel grid to maintain sharpness and consistency.
    *   **Padding and Spacing:** Maintain a minimum padding of 5px around the icon on its longest side to ensure it does not touch the edges of the canvas. Largest gap, smallest gap. _Note: Try to match the sizing of similar icons._
  
11.  ##### Style Consistency
    
    *   **Rounded Corners:** Use rounded corners with a radius between 4px-5px with an average of 4.5px to maintain a friendly and modern look.
    *   **Line Caps and Joins:** Use round line caps and joins to ensure smooth and cohesive lines.
  
13.  ##### Usage Guidelines
    
    *   **Scaling:** Icons should be scalable without losing quality. Always use vector formats for scaling (ie: .svg).
    *   **Background:** Icons should be designed to work on both light and dark backgrounds. Ensure sufficient contrast for visibility.
  
15.  ##### File Naming Conventions
    
    *   **Naming:** Use clear and descriptive names for each icon file (e.g., address-book.svg).
    *   **Versioning:** If there are multiple versions of an icon, use a suffix to differentiate them
        *   **Filled versions** use the same icon name with “.filled” included after the name, before the file extension (e.g., appointment.filled.svg).
        *   **Alternative versions** use the same icon name with “\_alt” included when offering two different types of an icon, like arrows. (e.g., go-next\_alt.svg vs go-next\_alt.svg).
    *   **Variants:** To show states or actions along with an icon, like adding a new contact, specify the status by appending the status with a dash to the name of the icon. (e.g., address-book-new.svg, printer-error.svg).
